# hello-world
This is a learning repository

Here is where I am learning to make a change. Then I will commit to the change (which means I save it), then eventually I will pull in other information from the master branch (if it has changed) and then I will eventually merge this branch back with the master.

My name is Tom. I am a math professor at PLU and I study algebra, combinatorics, and number theory. I love integer sequences and pictures that reveal how to prove certain theorems.
